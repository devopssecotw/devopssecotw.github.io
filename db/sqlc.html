Non-SQL is non relational.<br>\nIdeal Use Cases   SQL is best suitable for complex queries, multi-row transactions.   NoSQL is best suited for unstructured data or documents. Not ideal for complex queries.<br>\nHardware  Databases that support SQL require powerful hardware to support vertical scaling.   NonSQL databases require commodity hardware for horizontal scaling.<br>\nProperties    SQL enables ACID(atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability) properties  NonSQL follows CAP (consistency, availability, partition tolerance) properties.<br>\nData Storage  SQL does not support hierarchical storage of data.  NoSQL is best suited for hierarchical storage of data.<br>\nDistributed Data  SQL databases can only be run on a single system and hence, does not follow distribution of data.   NoSQL databases are designed to follow data distribution features like repetition, partition.<br>\nBest Features • Secure<br>\n• Cross Platform Support<br>\n• Free    • High Performance<br>\n• Flexible<br>\n• Easy to use<br>\nTop Companies Using   Microsoft, Dell, Cognizant, etc.    Amazon, Capgemini, Adobe, etc.<br>\nExamples  SQL supports databases like MySQL, SQL Server, Oracle, etc. Nosql databases are Hbase, MongoDB, Redis, etc."},{"t":"list_item","d":6,"p":{"lines":[414,417]},"v":"Pros/Advantages of SQL<br>\nCoding<br>\nNo prior knowledge of extensive coding is needed.
