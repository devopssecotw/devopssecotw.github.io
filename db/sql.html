NoSQL databases are a type of software that allows to maintain and retrieve structured, unstructured, polymorphic data for different purposes.<br>\nPurpose   A language used to communicate with databases for storage, deletion, updation, insertion and retrieval of data. A software to retrieve, store and manage scalability of databases.<br>\nDevelopment Year  SQL was developed in the year 1970 for flat file storage problems.  NoSQL was developed in 2000 as an enhanced version for SQL databases for unstructured and semi-structured data.<br>\nQuery Language    SQL databases support Structured Query Languages.   NonSQL does not have any declarative query language.<br>\nType  Supports table based data type. Supports document oriented, graph databases, key value pair-based.<br>\nScalability   Vertically Scalable  (Add resources to increase the capacity of the existing hardware and software).    Horizontally Scalable (Changing small nodes with larger nodes to increase the capacity of the existing hardware and software).<br>\nSchemas   SQL supports predefined schemas, making the storage of data restrictive to structured type only.    Nosql supports dynamic schemas to store different forms of data.<br>\nArchitecture  SQL is relational.  Non-SQL is non relational.<br>\nIdeal Use Cases   SQL is best suitable for complex queries, multi-row transactions.   NoSQL is best suited for unstructured data or documents. Not ideal for complex queries.<br>\nHardware  Databases that support SQL require powerful hardware to support vertical scaling.   NonSQL databases require commodity hardware for horizontal scaling.<br>\nProperties    SQL enables ACID(atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability) properties  NonSQL follows CAP (consistency, availability, partition tolerance) properties.<br>\nData Storage  SQL does not support hierarchical storage of data.  NoSQL is best suited for hierarchical storage of data.<br>\nDistributed Data  SQL databases can only be run on a single system and hence, does not follow distribution of data.   NoSQL databases are designed to follow data distribution features like repetition, partition.<br>\nBest Features • Secure<br>\n• Cross Platform Support<br>\n• Free    • High Performance<br>\n• Flexible<br>\n• Easy to use<br>\nTop Companies Using   Microsoft, Dell, Cognizant, etc.    Amazon, Capgemini, Adobe, etc.<br>\nExamples  SQL supports databases like MySQL, SQL Server, Oracle, etc. Nosql databases are Hbase, MongoDB, Redis, etc."},{"t":"list_item","d":6,"p":{"lines":[2078,2081]},"v":"Pros/Advantages of SQL<br>\nCoding<br>\nNo prior knowledge of extensive coding is needed.
